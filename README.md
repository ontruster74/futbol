- Check-Ins
----------------------------------
We are planning on having scheduled check-ins at 2:00 pm MST on Tuesday the 14th and Friday the 17th, as well as at 11:00 am on Monday the 20th. However, we also plan to check-in on a more continuous and less formal basis throughout the development of the project.

-----------------------------------
- Project Organization and Workflow
-----------------------------------
Our primary vehicle for collaboration will be through GitHub; specifically, developing parallel branches of the same project repository in tandem and merging them when necessary. All merges will be handled as a group; no group member will merge their own pull requests. All group efforts and responsibilites will be tracked through a Miro board (link:https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLuMoXq0=/) and jointly updated throughout the development process. The main body of the project can be broken into Game, League, and Season statistics methods; the team will attempt to complete one of these three categories of instanced methods collaboratavely each day.

----------------------------------
- How we made a decision on Project Organization
-----------------------------------
We discussed learning the usage of GitHub Projects to coordinate our work in this project, but decided it was too steep of an additional learning curve to manage for our first group development effort. Miro seemed like an efficient and easy to use alternative that we could all learn to use asynchronously in a short amount of time.


----------------------------------
- Approach to Code Design
----------------------------------
In addition to the required StatTracker class, we will need Team, Game, and Season classes to handle manipulation and sorting of the underlying CSV data for us. We will start by divying up the required Game Statistics Methods between the three of us and working on them asynchronously, so that each team member only has two or three methods to complete each day. On the next day, we will repeat this process with the League Statistics methods, and then once more with the Season Statistics on the day after that.

Iteration 3 Retrospective 
------------------------------------

For our retro, we used the EasyRetro online tool: https://easyretro.io/publicboard/bfWsAYUml2aXrJCv72tOrW7ybsM2/705879bf-e1ad-48ea-8c4f-391b64eb8ccb

3 Things That Went Well During The Project
-----------------------------------------------
1 (Logan): I think we did a great job of staying in communication with each other and making sure that we were all on the same page as far as working through the iterations at a good pace as a group.

2 (Patrick): I feel that the integration between methods and testing went a lot smoother than I expected. We had conflicts when merging to main, but it was mostly formatting issues. I like that we came together during the pull requests to do a little more live code eval, and worked through it together.

3 (Rig): The team did a great job of balancing both their synchronous and asynchronous efforts. In other words, I felt like I was able to make my own schedule during the project while still working closely with everyone else involved.

3 Things We Would Do Differently Next Time
--------------------------------------------------
1 (Logan): Take the initiative to host a "group work session" where I set up a huddle/zoom and work in there, even if it's cameras off. We talked about doing it at the beginning but I never followed through with it. So taking the initiative to set up the meeting and not wait for someone else to set it up.

2 (Patrick): In the future, I want to be more communicative of what and when I am working on stuff, so if I need to reach out for help it might be easier for others to help. And vice versa, if someone needs help it is easier for them to coordinate with me.

3 (Rig): It will be a good idea to slow down and review my code more carefully as I am writing it; good code is better than fast code. I will try to make my branches smaller in scope and plan their creation in advance so that they are easier to review with the group as a whole.
