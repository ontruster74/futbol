- Check-Ins
----------------------------------
We are planning on having scheduled check-ins at 2:00 pm MST on Tuesday the 14th and Friday the 17th, as well as at 11:00 am on Monday the 20th. However, we also plan to check-in on a more continuous and less formal basis throughout the development of the project.

-----------------------------------
- Project Organization and Workflow
-----------------------------------
Our primary vehicle for collaboration will be through GitHub; specifically, developing parallel branches of the same project repository in tandem and merging them when necessary. All merges will be handled as a group; no group member will merge their own pull requests. All group efforts and responsibilites will be tracked through a Miro board (link:https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLuMoXq0=/) and jointly updated throughout the development process. The main body of the project can be broken into Game, League, and Season statistics methods; the team will attempt to complete one of these three categories of instanced methods collaboratavely each day.

----------------------------------
- How we made a decision on Project Organization
-----------------------------------
We discussed learning the usage of GitHub Projects to coordinate our work in this project, but decided it was too steep of an additional learning curve to manage for our first group development effort. Miro seemed like an efficient and easy to use alternative that we could all learn to use asynchronously in a short amount of time.


----------------------------------
- Approach to Code Design
----------------------------------
In addition to the required StatTracker class, we will need Team, Game, and Season classes to handle manipulation and sorting of the underlying CSV data for us. We will start by divying up the required Game Statistics Methods between the three of us and working on them asynchronously, so that each team member only has two or three methods to complete each day. On the next day, we will repeat this process with the League Statistics methods, and then once more with the Season Statistics on the day after that.
